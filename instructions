✅ Run (build and start)

From your repo root (where docker-compose.yml lives):

docker compose up --build


That will:

build your frontend/Dockerfile

start the container (usually accessible at http://localhost:3000
)

stream the logs live in your terminal

If you’d rather run it in the background (detached):

docker compose up --build -d

🛑 Stop

To gracefully stop and remove the containers:

docker compose down


If you only want to stop but not remove the container:

docker compose stop


You can bring it back quickly:

docker compose start

🔍 Check status
docker compose ps

🧹 Clean up (optional)

Remove all stopped containers, unused images, and cache:

docker system prune -f
